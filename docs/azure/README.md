# Azure Secret Backends

## Supported Backends

The `datadog-secret-backend` utility currently supports the following Azure services:

| Backend Type | Azure Service |
| --- | --- |
| [azure.keyvault](keyvault.md) | [Azure Keyvault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal) |


## Azure Authentication

We recommend using Managed Identities in order to authenticate with Azure. This allowed associating cloud resources with AMI accounts, removing the need to put sensitive information in your `datadog.yaml` configuration file.

## Example Configuration

### Azure Managed Identity

```
# /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
---
secret_backend_type: azure.keyvault
secret_backend_config:
  keyvaulturl: "https://my-keyvault.vault.azure.net"
```

Review the [azure.keyvault](keyvault.md) backend documentation examples of configurations for Datadog Agent secrets.
